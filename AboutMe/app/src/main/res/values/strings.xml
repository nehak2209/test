    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks.
                    I love fish.
                     The kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
                    Fun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
                    I like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
                    And sometimes I even go fishing.
                    And even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
                    Once, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
                    I\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
                    You should ask someone else about fishing, though.
